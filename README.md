Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms for their game, Draw It or Lose It. The game is inspired by the game television game show Win,Lose, Draw. Which involves teams guessing phrases and titles based on drawings. The game will need to be scalable and cross compatible for a large player base as well as holding data for the games themselves and the drawings.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did particularly well writing with the evaluation portion of the document. I had to research Azure cloud services to answer the last portion of the document.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I will be using this technique in the future. It allows for a good level of organization and planning to keep it coheasive.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would rework the DOmain model portion. I feel I can learn to describe the model in a more efficient way.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs are important as they will be using the end product. If the product is not finalized, or secure it wont be used. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
It was important for the client to have a secure and scaleable product. That means it needs a cloud service that is scalable and reliable.
